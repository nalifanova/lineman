## Ideas and bug fix/features

### TODO

02. Finish the level (a lever? )
03. Assign another keys to play
04. Add name of the player
05. Add boss mechanics (follow is added)
06. Think of an inventory (as a Component it has gaps)
07. Can boss jump if he has follow mech?

04. Boss mechanics
05. Effects made with shaders
06. Add map of finished levels (w/o possibility to restart the level)
