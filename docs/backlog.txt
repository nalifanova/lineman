## Ideas and bug fix/features

There's a list (not an order) of things to be done.

### TODO
01. Add save game functionality (save only time/inks and life) - done
02. Finish the level (a lever? )
03. Assign another keys to play
04. Add name of the player
05. Add boss mechanics (maybe follow mech too)
06. Think of a inventory (as a Component it has gaps)
09. Modify changeScene/load next level logic
10. Add NPCs that can jump and/or follow


### THINK OF
01. Count all consumables
02. Score based on collected consumables and time passed the level
03. Display Score/Lives/Time (maybe time) / Name?
    Life and Inks are displayed. Should we move it to another level?
04. Boss mechanics
05. Effects made with shaders
06. Add map of finished levels (w/o possibility to restart the level)
07. Add parallax (have no idea what to put on background)
08. Add moving platforms (maybe with disappearing effect)
09. Add menu cooldown animation

### MUST BE DONE
01. Three different NPC (one is done)
02. Add a moving platform/elevator
03. Overworld map?
04. Add three shaders
05. Add parallax
... NPC pathfinding (follow the player)
... Add Audio
... Add menu to change (music volume, game difficulty, rebind keys)
... Raycasting
