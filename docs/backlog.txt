## Ideas and bug fix/features

There's a list (not an order) of things to be done.

### TODO
01. Add save game functionality (if you pass the level - save the level?)
    (Should we save all consumables or start the level with brand-new settings?)
02. New Game / Load Game (menu)
03. Assign another keys to play
04. Add name of the player
05. Add score table of players
06. Add number of lives
07. Add throwable
08. Add boss
09. Modify changeScene/load next level logic
10. Add NPCs that can jump and/or follow
11. Add gameover (when lives are over or no condition to finish the level)
12. Add attack

### THINK OF
01. Count all consumables
02. Score based on collected consumables and time passed the level
03. Display Score/Lives/Time (maybe time) / Name?
    Where to store lives?
04. Boss mechanics
05. Effects made with shaders
06. Add map of finished levels (w/o possibility to restart the level)
07. Add parallax (have no idea what to put on background)
08. Add moving platforms (maybe with disappearing effect)
09. Add menu cooldown animation
