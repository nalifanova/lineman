## About a course
[Video Lectures on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xRyXins848nDj2v-TJYahzvs-XW9sVV)
COMP 4300 - C++ Game Programming (2022-09) by Dave Churchill


## Description

A line man is walking down the paper sheets and collects ink bottles.

Requirements to a project are taken from [Project Specification](https://github.com/davechurchill/COMP4300_Project/tree/main/Project%20Specification).
The copy can be found [here](SPECIFICATION.md)

## Supported OS

- It definitely works on macOS 15.0
- Tested on Win10 (there are some bugs but it works)

## Dependencies
- SFML 2.6.x
- DearImGui 1.91.0
- ImGui-SFML 2.6.x

## Dev Notes
I'm using CLion as my IDE, and I try to follow a guideline from
[CLion:](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/clangformat-as-alternative-formatter.html)
along with the style the lecturer provided in his examples.

### Guide style
* Each row of text in your code should be at most 120 characters long;
* Use a .cpp suffix for code files and .hpp for interface files;
* [Names and order of includes](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Names_and_Order_of_Includes)
  Related header, C system headers, C++ standard library headers, other headers;
* In a class I prefer to see public methods, private methods, public vars, private vars. Exactly
  in this order.

### My Thoughts
It is still in process. I'd say the project is quite challenging! ðŸ¤“
